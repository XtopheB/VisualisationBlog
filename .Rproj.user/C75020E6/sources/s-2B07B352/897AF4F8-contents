> Installing *gganimate*, a piece of cake...

`gganimate` is an  appealing package I really wanted to try, but for that I needed first to install it on my windows machine. That was not easy but here is the successful (but time consuming) story of  this installation. `gganimate` is **NOT** available on CRAN yet but can be installed, as many developers' packages using *devtools* pointing to the GitHub repository of [thomasp85](https://github.com/thomasp85) (alias Thomas Lin Pedersen). 
For the occasion, I first updated R to the current (3.5.1) version. The instruction for installing `gganimate` as read on  thomasp85's [readme.md](https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate#installation) is:

````{r , results= "hide"}
# install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('thomasp85/gganimate')

````

My post would have been short and uninteresting if that simple instruction was successful. After several dependency package installation, I get the following quite unambiguous message:

````{r , results= "hide"}
* removing 'C:/Users/Xtophe/Documents/R/win-library/3.5/gganimate'
In R CMD INSTALL
'Installation failed: Command failed (1)'
````



I will go directly to the solution, avoiding the reader to follow my  time-consuming, nerve-streching tribulations on the web. The one thing that was missing was ``Rtools``, which is not an R package but a utility required to build R packages, and `gganimate` needs that. 

> *gganimate* needs *Rtools* for its installation...

Since `Rtools` is **NOT** an R package, its installation under Rstudio can be tricky, but I found out that using `installR` (an R package used to help updating  R) may simplify the  process. So the first trick is to use `installR` to install `Rtools`:

````{r , results= "hide"}
library(installR)
install.Rtools()

````

This is quite a lengthy process, with many windows prompts. I opted for the latest version (3.5) and let the system option by default (install in C:/Rtools/).

I read carefully the installation messages and checked all the elements that seemed to be useful such as adding  rtools to system path. I will come back to that later on.  

The installation went fine, but the instruction:
````{r , results= "hide"}
devtools::install_github('thomasp85/gganimate')
````

still ended-up with several error messages and  a definitive:

````{r , results= "hide"}
'Installation failed: Command failed (1)'
````
> ... and *Rtools* does not install smoothly on Windows/Rstudio

This is where a second trick must be used, as I found out very lately. It seems that  [there is a quirk about running Rcpp (and  Rtools) on Windows through RStudio](https://statbandit.wordpress.com/2017/07/20/quirks-about-running-rcpp-on-windows-through-rstudio/). For whatever reason (you do not want to know), the installation of `Rtools` on *Windows/Rstudio* does not add the right path to the working environment. So one must add it manually.  For me, with `Rtools` installed in `C:\Rtools`, the following  line of code worked well:

````{r , results= "hide"}
Sys.setenv(PATH = paste(Sys.getenv("PATH"), "C:/Rtools/bin/",
                        "C:/Rtools/mingw_64/bin", sep = ";"))
Sys.setenv(BINPREF = "C:/Rtools/mingw_64/bin/")
````

End of the story? Not yet. One must first restart R (restart Rstudio) before running again: 

````{r , results= "hide"}
devtools::install_github('thomasp85/gganimate')
````

and finally get:
````{r , results= "hide"}
* DONE (gganimate)
In R CMD INSTALL
````

Now `gganimate` is working, and I'm beginning to enjoy it, finally. I hope it was worth the trip.
